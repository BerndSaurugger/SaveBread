# Unit 1
The first sprint was a bit chaotic since we only just started working together and had to set up the basics of the project, what needs to be done, what is possible, what is the scope, who is able to do what, etc.

Even though it was chaotic it was very useful and since it was the first time we collaborated it is to be expected.

At the end of the sprint we had a pretty clear goal of what we wanted to accomplish as an MVP, how we split up the project and which data we got available. This reduced the risk we faced from external factors to close to 0. Even if we find out that the predictions aren't very accurate, we can still create the product.


# Unit 2
The meeting setup has improved a lot and we have got a lot of structure.
Everyone had a clear role and knew what to work on, which I found to be great at the second sprint.

The separation of concerns worked great so far, the three modules preprocessing, modeling and visualization are separate and we haven't had conflicts merging everything together.

We had a couple of pair programming sessions and I jumed in the sprint from "team to team" and helped them with issues and make the requirements clear.
The major parts of the CICD Pipeline were set up in that time

# Unit 3
Some of the pain points came up.
There was work done which was not really integratable into the product.
Some requirements were unclear and work was done which would not have needed to be done.
One of the learnings of the sprint is to do a more throughout sprint planning and to really make the point clear to ask questions when it's not 100% clear. It's better to ask than to produce something noone really needs.

We did a retrospective in the team which was very productive.
We got a lot of issues together and some ways in which to improve them.

Overall the project went very well, everyone seemed to learn something usefull, and we had a working prototype pretty early on. SCRUM and agile development worked well for this project where the outcome was uncertain at first.

There is still some ambiguity about the knowledge of the whole architecture and how each part fits together which will be adressed by an architecture meeting where we spend some time going through questions and how the program works from a "birds perspective".
