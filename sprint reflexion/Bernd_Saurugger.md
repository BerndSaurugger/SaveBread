### Sprint Reflexion

#### Sprint 1

Good

- Pairing up (one googd and one bad coder) to upskill each other/
- working with branches (not optimal but quite okay)/
- the actual coding process/


to be improved

- setting up appiontmaints (took a few tries)/
- distribution of tasks (it was hard to undestand who is doing what)/
- commit messages

#### Sprint 2

Good

- Working with branches was improved
- Appoinments got improved
- pairing up was still perfect


to be improved

- big picture is missing (how will everything fit together)
- issues with the dataset (is getting on my nerves > we should start to just make the best out of it)

#### Sprint 3

Good

- Big picture has emerged 
- sprint organisation in general
- good vibes of the team

to be improved

- understanding of when the product is final <3
